# Yoga Pose Prediction using different machine learning models

## Introduction
This project, "Yoga Pose Predicition using Machine Learning," aims to develop a robust system capable of prediciting yoga poses from images. By Using Some machine learning algorithms like Decision tree,Random Forest and KNN and CNN.  
And Calculated the accurarcies among the 4 Algorithm techniques.and prediciting the model which gives the best accuracy and which model best suitable for prediciting the yoga poses.  

## About the Dataset
we have taken this dataset from the Kaggle.and the dataset consist of 1081 images of 5 classes of different poses like plank,tree,downdog,goddess and warrior.and we split the data into train and validation as 80 and 20 ratio.

## Models Used

We have used four different model techniques in this project and we compare the accuracies for all the four models and plot the bar graph based on the accuracies. and predicting the model which gives more accuracy and which model is best suitable for Predicting the yoga poses accurately.

**We have used four different models**
- Decision Tree(CART)
- Random Forest
- KNN(k-nearest neighbor algorithm)
- CNN(convolutional neural network)

## Comparing Accuracies

After sucussfully training the model with four different algorithms we compare the accuracies for all the four different techniques and plot the bar graph by comparing the accuracies.and we got more acccuracy by using the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) i.e 98%.

## Objectives
- **Pose Recognition:**  We endeavor to build a model capable of accurately recognizing and categorizing various yoga poses depicted in images.
- **Dataset Exploration:** We will explore a comprehensive dataset containing images of different yoga poses, providing insights into the diversity and distribution of samples.
- **Model Development:** Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we will develop and train models to classify yoga poses based on image inputs.
